                    Emails make me waste my time. But I need them.
                    Given the importance that emails have in our lives,
                    it's incredible it's still one of the only software
                    areas that did not evolve in the past 20 years!
                </p><p>
                    Reading my inbox is the most unproductive task I do
                    on a daily basis. I have to spend one full hour a
                    day to process my emails. All the junk flows in the
                    same inbox; spams, information that doesn't matter,
                    quoted answers of quoted answers, etc. At the end
                    of the hour, only 10 emails actually requested an
                    answer from me. With a good tool, I could have done
                    my job in 10 minutes!

                <p>
                    Here are the ideas behind the Odoo communication tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get Things Done: your inbox is a
                        todo list. You should be able to process (not only
                        read) the inbox and easily mark messages for future
                        actions. Every inbox should be empty after having
                        been processed; no more overload of information.
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/website_blog/static/src/img/mail-sc-00.png" alt=""/>
                    </li><li>
                        Keep control of what you want to receive or don't want
                        to receive. People should never receive spam. You
                        should follow/unfollow any kind of information in one
                        click.
                    </li><li>
                        Productivity is key: our smart user
                        interface does not require you to click on every mail
                        to read a thread. Reading a full thread, replying,
                        attaching documents is super fast.
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/website_blog/static/src/img/mail-sc-03.png" alt=""/>
                    </li><li>
                        A mix of push & pull: Today, people
                        are victims of what others decide to push to them.
                        Odoo differentiates:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Messages "for information":
                                you can pull them when you need some specific
                                information; they are not required to be read
                                every day.You receive only what you decided
                                to follow.This accounts for 90% of your daily
                                emails.Use the "Inbox" menu for these.
                            </li><li>
                                Messages "for action": they
                                require your immediate attention and you need
                                to process them all. This accounts for 10%
                                of your daily emails. Use the "To: me" menu
                                for these.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><li>
                        Focus on the Content: Everything is
                        stripped to emphasize on the real message. No more
                        welcome introductions, greetings, signatures and legal
                        notes.We standardize the layout of each message.
                        (signatures are on the profile of a contact, not in
                        every message)
                    </li><li>
                        Folders and mailing lists are great tools but too
                        complex in traditional email clients. In Odoo, a
                        group of contacts that share a discussion can be
                        created with one click. Every group should have it's
                        own email address.
                    </li>

                    At Odoo, we build tools to bring productivity to
                    enterprises. As emails and information flows are one of
                    the biggest wastes of time in companies, we have to fix
                    this.

                    To disrupt emails, you need more than just another user

                <h3>The Communication Mechanism of Odoo</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are the ideas behind the Odoo communication tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get Things Done: your inbox is a
                        todo list. You should be able to process (not only
                        read) the inbox and easily mark messages for future
                        actions. Every inbox should be empty after having
                        been processed; no more overload of information.
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/website_blog/static/src/img/mail-sc-00.png" alt=""/>
                    </li><li>
                        Keep control of what you want to receive or don't want
                        to receive. People should never receive spam. You
                        should follow/unfollow any kind of information in one
                        click.
                    </li><li>
                        Productivity is key: our smart user
                        interface does not require you to click on every mail
                        to read a thread. Reading a full thread, replying,
                        attaching documents is super fast.
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/website_blog/static/src/img/mail-sc-03.png" alt=""/>
                    </li><li>
                        A mix of push & pull: Today, people
                        are victims of what others decide to push to them.
                        Odoo differentiates:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Messages "for information":
                                you can pull them when you need some specific
                                information; they are not required to be read
                                every day.You receive only what you decided
                                to follow.This accounts for 90% of your daily
                                emails.Use the "Inbox" menu for these.
                            </li><li>
                                Messages "for action": they
                                require your immediate attention and you need
                                to process them all. This accounts for 10%
                                of your daily emails. Use the "To: me" menu
                                for these.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><li>
                        Focus on the Content: Everything is
                        stripped to emphasize on the real message. No more
                        welcome introductions, greetings, signatures and legal
                        notes.We standardize the layout of each message.
                        (signatures are on the profile of a contact, not in
                        every message)
                    </li><li>
                        Folders and mailing lists are great tools but too
                        complex in traditional email clients. In Odoo, a
                        group of contacts that share a discussion can be
                        created with one click. Every group should have it's
                        own email address.

                    Emails make me waste my time. But I need them.

                    Reading my inbox is the most unproductive task I do
                    on a daily basis. I have to spend one full hour a
                    day to process my emails. All the junk flows in the

                        are victims of what others decide to push to them.

                <h3>The Communication Mechanism of Odoo</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are the ideas behind the Odoo communication tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get Things Done: your inbox is a
                        todo list. You should be able to process (not only
                        read) the inbox and easily mark messages for future
                        actions. Every inbox should be empty after having
                        been processed; no more overload of information.

                    </li><li>
                        Keep control of what you want to receive or don't want
                        to receive. People should never receive spam. You
                        should follow/unfollow any kind of information in one
                        click.
                    </li><li>
                        Productivity is key: our smart user
                        interface does not require you to click on every mail
                        to read a thread. Reading a full thread, replying,
                        attaching documents is super fast.

                                Messages "for information":
                                you can pull them when you need some specific
                                information; they are not required to be read
                                every day.You receive only what you decided
                                to follow.This accounts for 90% of your daily
                                emails.Use the "Inbox" menu for these.
                            </li><li>
                                Messages "for action": they
                                require your immediate attention and you need
                                to process them all. This accounts for 10%
                                of your daily emails. Use the "To: me" menu
                                for these.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><li>
                        Focus on the Content: Everything is
                        stripped to emphasize on the real message. No more
                        welcome introductions, greetings, signatures and legal
                        notes.We standardize the layout of each message.
                        (signatures are on the profile of a contact, not in
                        every message)
                    </li><li>
                        Folders and mailing lists are great tools but too
                        complex in traditional email clients. In Odoo, a
                        group of contacts that share a discussion can be
                        created with one click. Every group should have it's
                        own email address.

                    Reading my inbox is the most unproductive task I do
                    on a daily basis. I have to spend one full hour a
                    day to process my emails. All the junk flows in the
                    same inbox; spams, information that doesn't matter,
                    quoted answers of quoted answers, etc. At the end
                    of the hour, only 10 emails actually requested an
                    answer from me. With a good tool, I could have done

                    Emails make me waste my time. But I need them.
                    Given the importance that emails have in our lives,
                    it's incredible it's still one of the only software

                    Reading my inbox is the most unproductive task I do
                    on a daily basis. I have to spend one full hour a
                    day to process my emails. All the junk flows in the
                    same inbox; spams, information that doesn't matter,
                    quoted answers of quoted answers, etc. At the end
                    of the hour, only 10 emails actually requested an
                    answer from me. With a good tool, I could have done

                    At Odoo, we build tools to bring productivity to
                    enterprises. As emails and information flows are one of
                    the biggest wastes of time in companies, we have to fix
                    this.

                    To disrupt emails, you need more than just another user
                    interface. We need to rethink the whole communication flow.

                <h3>The Communication Mechanism of Odoo</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are the ideas behind the Odoo communication tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get Things Done: your inbox is a
                        todo list. You should be able to process (not only
                        read) the inbox and easily mark messages for future
                        actions. Every inbox should be empty after having
                        been processed; no more overload of information.
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/website_blog/static/src/img/mail-sc-00.png" alt=""/>
                    </li><li>
                        Keep control of what you want to receive or don't want
                        to receive. People should never receive spam. You
                        should follow/unfollow any kind of information in one
                        click.
                    </li><li>
                        Productivity is key: our smart user
                        interface does not require you to click on every mail
                        to read a thread. Reading a full thread, replying,
                        attaching documents is super fast.

                    </li><li>
                        A mix of push & pull: Today, people
                        are victims of what others decide to push to them.

                                you can pull them when you need some specific
                                information; they are not required to be read
                                every day.You receive only what you decided

                    </li><li>
                        Focus on the Content: Everything is

                    Reading my inbox is the most unproductive task I do

                    day to process my emails. All the junk flows in the

                    At Odoo, we build tools to bring productivity to
                    enterprises. As emails and information flows are one of
                    the biggest wastes of time in companies, we have to fix
                    this.
                </p><p>
                    To disrupt emails, you need more than just another user
                    interface. We need to rethink the whole communication flow.

                <h3>The Communication Mechanism of Odoo</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are the ideas behind the Odoo communication tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get Things Done: your inbox is a
                        todo list. You should be able to process (not only
                        read) the inbox and easily mark messages for future
                        actions. Every inbox should be empty after having
                        been processed; no more overload of information.
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/website_blog/static/src/img/mail-sc-00.png" alt=""/>
                    </li><li>
                        Keep control of what you want to receive or don't want
                        to receive. People should never receive spam. You
                        should follow/unfollow any kind of information in one
                        click.
                    </li><li>
                        Productivity is key: our smart user
                        interface does not require you to click on every mail
                        to read a thread. Reading a full thread, replying,
                        attaching documents is super fast.
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/website_blog/static/src/img/mail-sc-03.png" alt=""/>
                    </li><li>
                        A mix of push & pull: Today, people
                        are victims of what others decide to push to them.
                        Odoo differentiates:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Messages "for information":
                                you can pull them when you need some specific
                                information; they are not required to be read
                                every day.You receive only what you decided
                                to follow.This accounts for 90% of your daily
                                emails.Use the "Inbox" menu for these.
                            </li><li>
                                Messages "for action": they
                                require your immediate attention and you need
                                to process them all. This accounts for 10%
                                of your daily emails. Use the "To: me" menu
                                for these.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><li>
                        Focus on the Content: Everything is
                        stripped to emphasize on the real message. No more
                        welcome introductions, greetings, signatures and legal
                        notes.We standardize the layout of each message.
                        (signatures are on the profile of a contact, not in
                        every message)
                    </li><li>
                        Folders and mailing lists are great tools but too
                        complex in traditional email clients. In Odoo, a
                        group of contacts that share a discussion can be
                        created with one click. Every group should have it's
                        own email address.

                        to receive. People should never receive spam. You
                        should follow/unfollow any kind of information in one
                        click.

                        Productivity is key: our smart user
                        interface does not require you to click on every mail
                        to read a thread. Reading a full thread, replying,
                        attaching documents is super fast.

                        A mix of push & pull: Today, people
                        are victims of what others decide to push to them.
                        Odoo differentiates:

                            <li>
                                Messages "for information":
                                you can pull them when you need some specific
                                information; they are not required to be read
                                every day.You receive only what you decided
                                to follow.This accounts for 90% of your daily
                                emails.Use the "Inbox" menu for these.
                            </li><li>
                                Messages "for action": they
                                require your immediate attention and you need
                                to process them all. This accounts for 10%
                                of your daily emails. Use the "To: me" menu
                                for these.
                            </li>

                        welcome introductions, greetings, signatures and legal
                        notes.We standardize the layout of each message.
                        (signatures are on the profile of a contact, not in
                        every message)

                        Folders and mailing lists are great tools but too
                        complex in traditional email clients. In Odoo, a
                        group of contacts that share a discussion can be
                        created with one click. Every group should have it's
                        own email address.

                    Emails are broken.
                </p><p>
                    Emails make me waste my time. But I need them.
                    Given the importance that emails have in our lives,
                    it's incredible it's still one of the only software
                    areas that did not evolve in the past 20 years!
                </p><p>
                    Reading my inbox is the most unproductive task I do
                    on a daily basis. I have to spend one full hour a
                    day to process my emails. All the junk flows in the
                    same inbox; spams, information that doesn't matter,
                    quoted answers of quoted answers, etc. At the end
                    of the hour, only 10 emails actually requested an
                    answer from me. With a good tool, I could have done
                    my job in 10 minutes!

                    At Odoo, we build tools to bring productivity to

                    the biggest wastes of time in companies, we have to fix
                    this.

                    To disrupt emails, you need more than just another user
                    interface. We need to rethink the whole communication flow.

                <h3>The Communication Mechanism of Odoo</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are the ideas behind the Odoo communication tools:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get Things Done: your inbox is a
                        todo list. You should be able to process (not only
                        read) the inbox and easily mark messages for future
                        actions. Every inbox should be empty after having
                        been processed; no more overload of information.
